Intro:
This project is a Javascript program for a racing competition between three different sorting algorithms. The program will run several algorithms in an interleaved fashion, where each algorithm will get a turn to perform a single Step (one of its complexity operations) in its run, and thereby it may rearrange its current pass Sort Array. Any Sort Array changes for each algorithm's Step will be displayed on the program's HTML web page in a browser.
